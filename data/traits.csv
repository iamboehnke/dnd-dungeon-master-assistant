trait
Speaks only in riddles
Obsessed with rare cheeses
Keeps a journal of every cloud they see
Terrified of birds
Believes they are the chosen one
Wonâ€™t stop humming old war songs
Has a pet rock collection
Writes poetry about inanimate objects
Loves to wear mismatched socks
Thinks they can communicate with plants
Has an irrational fear of spoons
Collects antique keys
Believes they can time travel
Has a nervous peeing problem and they will pee if they are scared
